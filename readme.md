# Here you can find some projects that I made during web-dev-course that I took last year.
## I wanted to show that I have some knowledge with node and bootstrap.
## I didn't want to make a mess in my repositories list, so I created this folder to upload projects that I find more interesting.
### Project:
1. BlogWebsite
2. TinDog-basic-website
